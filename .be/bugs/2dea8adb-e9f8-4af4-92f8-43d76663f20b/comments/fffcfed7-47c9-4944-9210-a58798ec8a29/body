Currently, the geometrical universe needs to be given to the
READ-DEFINITIONS-FILES function, but it should be possible to omit it
and have it read from the configuration file. Reading a 'gcs' form
before reading a 'universe' when there is none provided in the
function call should then trigger an error (note that reading a
valuation shouldn't, though).
