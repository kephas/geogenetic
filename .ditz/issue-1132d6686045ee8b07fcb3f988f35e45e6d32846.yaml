title: Read universe from configuration file
desc: |-
  Currently, the geometrical universe needs to be given to the
  READ-DEFINITIONS-FILES function, but it should be possible to omit it
  and have it read from the configuration file. Reading a 'gcs' form
  before reading a 'universe' when there is none provided in the function
  call should then trigger an error (note that reading a valuation
  shouldn't, though).
